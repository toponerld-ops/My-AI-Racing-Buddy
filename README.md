-- My AI Racing Buddy (or ash) --

Building an AI-controlled FPV racing drone to be my racing partner since I have no one to race with.

The Setup
- **Drone 1 (Me):** Controlled with my Avionic transmitter
- **Drone 2 (AI):** Controlled by Raspberry Pi with computer vision
- **Ground Station:** Pi processes FPV feeds, sends commands

Why?
I love FPV racing but it's boring alone. Building my own opponent!

Tech Stack
- 75mm brushless whoops
- Raspberry Pi 4 + GPS + camera
- OpenCV for drone tracking
- Custom 3D printed frames

Progress
- [ ] Design drone frames in Fusion 360
- [ ] Order parts
- [ ] Build drone
- [ ] Code AI control
- [ ] First race!
