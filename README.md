# My-AI-Racing-Buddy
I love FPV racing (never actually flew or built one but love watchin them hopin i can finally build them ) but have no one to race with. So I'm building my own AI opponent. One drone I control with my transmitter, the other is controlled by a Raspberry Pi that watches the FPV feed and tries to follow/race me. Finally gonna have a racing buddy!
